# Navya Sri Alaparthi

I recently graduated from NMIMS University with a MBA degree in Information Technology. At school, I knew I want to work as a mobile developer from day one. So, my course work reflected that over the past three summers, I have interned with one start-up and two mid-size companies, which gave me an opportunity to work closely with their mobile developers and learn from them. Apart from this I love to read books in library.
